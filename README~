The cycle accurate simulation (modelsim/icarus Verilog) is inside the folder ./ref-sim
The simulation can be done by entering "make rtl-test" in ./ref-sim/sim/run

The reason for a separate simulation folder is because there is some modules in implementation cannot be simulated, for example, advanced debug system, ppl etc.
One-size-fit-all approach would make the code complex and difficult to read, therefore, we take an alternative approach by separating the folder.

However, it is important to make sure that the modules inside simulation and implementation are synchronized. In CypherDB project, our interest is on the or1200 module.
